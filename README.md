# Simple Emacs Config

## Synopsis
I have a very complex emacs config. So complex that it is hard for me to get it set exactly how I need it to be. This config will be my attempt at creating a much simpler config, that hopefully can be very usable also.

I've copied a great config from https://github.com/Compro-Prasad/emacs-config to build off of.

## Install
Clone this repo and then it should automatically setup everything when you first run emacs
